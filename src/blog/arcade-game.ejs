    <p>This is the third project of the intermediate JavaScript section for Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree. It's a version of the classic frogger arcade-game. The basic requirements for this projects are:</p>
    &nbsp
    <p>The player has to reach the water without colliding into the enemies (bugs).</p>
    <p>The player can move up, down, left and right without falling out of the screen.</p>
    <p>The enemies run on the paved block portion of the scene at various speeds.</p>
    <p>The game resets when the player collides into an enemy.</p>
    <p>When the player reaches the water the game is won.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">What I've learned:</span>
    This project's goal is to learn about object-oriented programming. All functions must be either class functions or class prototype functions. I've learned how to write coherent class prototype functions as well as how the scope and prototype chains works. I've also learned how to use canvas to draw patterns, text and how to create animated elements.</p>
